- finish writing basic test cases from ch. 5.
- write a labeling function that does labeling after parsing, to give a top 
  down rather than a bottom up ordering for the label numbers (which is present
  now).
- write syntactic labeling functions for each program statement S (at[S],
  after[S], escape[S], break-to[S]).
- write an assignment sequence program that keeps track of most recent 
  variable assigned.
- similarly, write a program that keeps track of signs.
- extend grammar and program as a whole to handle more boolean and arithmetic
  constructs.
