~~- finish writing basic test cases from ch. 5.~~
- write a labeling function that does labeling after parsing, to give a top 
  down rather than a bottom up ordering for the label numbers (which is present
  now).
- write syntactic labeling functions for each program statement S (at[S],
  after[S], escape[S], break-to[S]).
- extend grammar, make test case for each extension.
